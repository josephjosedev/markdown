**HEADING 1**
<P>This is the main heading on a page and should only be used once on each page / document. It has the most importance on the page.</P>

>The markdown syntax is:

```
# Heading 1
```
>When rendered this would result in a html tag of "h1":
```
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
```

**Heading 2**
<P>This is very similar to Heading 1, but has 2 hashes ("##") and results in a "h2" html tag:</p>

```
  ## Heading 2
  ```
  
  >When rendered this would result in a html tag of "h2":
  
  ```
  <h2>Heading 2</h2>
  ```
  >"h3", "h4", "h5", "h6" follow the same pattern and style as "h1"
  
  ```
        # Heading 1
        ## Heading 2
        ### Heading 3
        #### Heading 4
        ##### Heading 5
        ###### Heading 6
      
     
        <h1>Heading 1</h1>
        <h2>Heading 2</h2>
        <h3>Heading 3</h3>
        <h4>Heading 4</h4>
